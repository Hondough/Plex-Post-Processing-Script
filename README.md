# PlexPostProc
Plex PostProcessing Script for DVR(Beta) on Ubuntu 14.04 (or later) Server

If you're like me, you probably just want a no-frills/no-fuss script to convert your recorded content from Plex DVR, down to a much smaller file size.  Personally, I wanted to downsize more significantly, so I convert to 720p as well.  Your mileage may vary and you can play with handbrake's settings to get just the right config for you.  

I was getting frustrated trying to get FFMpeg and Comskip working / built / installed so I basically went the easy route and just installed handbrake CLI (for headless operation) and a very, very simple script to do the conversion.  All seems to be working fine in its current state so I'm happy to share with the world.

Update: I've added FFMPEG support because I found I had audio synch issues with HandBrake CLI.

Update: Added some logging and lockfile capability (inspired by (this blog by thatvirtualboy)[https://thatvirtualboy.com/2017/11/28/plex-dvr-postprocessing-script.html]), to try and work around an issue with Plex where it deletes all .grab folders/files after one script completes.  This obviously isn't a good scenario if we have simultaneous scripts running.  

## Prereqs
FFMPEG

### How to install the right version of Handbrake CLI on Ubuntu 14.04 server

Install FFMPEG from the native repository (optionally build your own or grab from another repo)  
~~~~
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ffmpeg
~~~~

## Installation

First you will need to get the script onto your machine.  You can do this by cloning my git repository or simply downloading and placing in a directory of your choice.  

~~~~
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install git
git clone -b FFMPEG-Branch https://github.com/nebhead/PlexPostProc
cd PlexPostProc
sudo chmod 777 PlexPostProc.sh
~~~~

Now go to Plex's webui and go to server settings > DVR (Beta) > DVR Settings

From there you should be able to enter the path to the post processing script and you should be done.  

For example:
~~~~
\home\[your-username]\PlexPostProc\PlexPostProc.sh
~~~~
_Where [your-username] is replaced with your username._

That's it.  

Happy Post-Processing!

## Troubleshoooting

It has been noted that in some cases (for example on MacOS or FreeBSD OSes) the script will fail due to the fact that the FFMPEG or Handbrake binary is not found on the system.  In these cases, you may need to modify the script to include the full path to the executable.

For example, change this line:

~~~~
ffmpeg -i "$FILENAME" -s hd720 -c:v libx264 -preset veryfast -vf yadif -c:a copy "$TEMPFILENAME"
~~~~

To this:

~~~~
/usr/local/bin/ffmpeg -i "$FILENAME" -s hd720 -c:v libx264 -preset veryfast -vf yadif -c:a copy "$TEMPFILENAME"
~~~~

Where "/usr/local/bin" is the path to the executable.
